if you try to downsample without having filtered to 1/2 of what you're going to downsampled to, its going to try to downsample to prevent aliasing
filter before you split to epochs, then downsample
low-pass filter at half the sample rate, or less, before you epoch
low-pass filter at 300 hz before epoching (1)
notch filter everything up to 300 hz (2)

epoch (3)

down-sample to 1200 hz (4)

50, 100, 150, 200, 250
filter line noise, regressing out a sine wave, does that instead of using a 2hz window

then split the data up (5)
one version high-pass filtered at 1 hz
one version high-pass filtered from 30 to 270

ICA with version of data high-pass filtered at 1 hz (6)

apply ICA epoch rejection to version of data high-pass filtered from 30 to 270 (7)




add reference back in?


I'd love for you to come ice skating, I think it'll be tons of fun
I wasn't sure if I'm making things weird

it's been great to hang out overall
I actually just not sure if I'm 


Same here

same! and don't get me wrong, you should totally come if you want
I think it will be fun ðŸ™‚
I was probably coming on a bit strong, I was excited to get to know you, but I don't want to make things weird
